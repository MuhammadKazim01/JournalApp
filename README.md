# JournalApp Backend

Welcome to the repository for **JournalApp**'s backend! This is a digital journaling platform built with **Spring Boot**. The backend is designed to handle secure user authentication, manage journal entries, and provide reliable data storage using **MongoDB** and **Redis**, all while ensuring scalability and security.

## Key Features:

- **RESTful APIs**: Provides endpoints for users to create, update, and delete journal entries.
- **User Authentication**: Uses **JWT** for secure login and session management.
- **Database**: Utilizes **MongoDB** for storing user data and journal entries, offering flexibility and scalability, and **Redis** for caching to enhance performance and reduce latency.
- **API Documentation**: Integrated **Swagger** for automatic API documentation, allowing easy exploration of available endpoints.
- **Security**: Implements **password hashing**, **data encryption**, and secure API practices to protect user data.

The backend is structured to be modular, scalable, and easily maintainable, supporting future feature expansion. It serves as a robust foundation for **JournalApp**, enabling a seamless journaling experience across multiple platforms.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out with any questions!
